image5.jpeg,Pseudostratified Ciliated Columnar Epithelium Respiratory epithelium is pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium. Seromucous glands provide lubricating mucus.

image7.jpeg,LarynxThe larynx extends from the laryngopharynx and the hyoid bone to the trachea.

image9.jpeg,Trachea(a) The tracheal tube is formed by stacked C-shaped pieces of hyaline cartilage.(b)The layer visible in this cross-section of tracheal wall tissue between the hyaline cartilage and the lumen of the trachea is the mucosa which is composed of pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium that contains gobletcells.
image10.jpeg,Respiratory Zone Bronchioles lead to alveolar sacs in the respiratory zone where gas exchange occurs.
image11.jpeg,Structures of the Respiratory Zone (a) The alveolus is responsible for gas exchange. (b) A micrograph shows the alveolar structures within lung tissue. 
image12.jpeg,Normal and Bronchial Asthma Tissues (a) Normal lung tissue does not have the characteristics of lung tissue during (b) an asthma attack which include thickened mucosa increased mucus-producing goblet cells and eosinophil infiltrates.
